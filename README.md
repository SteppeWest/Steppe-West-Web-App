# Steppe West Yii2 (basic) Web App

This is a web application, in Yii2, for a very specific use case of Steppe West. I have given no consideration to how useful it may be to anyone else. If you do find anything here useful, do what you like with it.

Docs are excluded from the repository until (and if) I make a version without confidential information.
